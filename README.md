# Cartography Project Representation on Facebook

## Introduction

Nancy Fraser once described political representation as furnishing the stage where struggles for recognition and distribution occur. This stage, however, can be quite small. Brazil's democratic institutions have been historically criticized for failing to give voice to a range of social actors. The present study sought to investigate whether Facebook reinforces, or subverts, this diagnosis.

This repository contains the codes and data for answering this question.
